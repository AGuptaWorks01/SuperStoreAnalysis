## Project Title: Superstore Sales and Profit Analysis
# Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook, CSV

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sales and profit analysis using the Superstore dataset. We analyze different business metrics such as monthly sales, profit distribution by category, and sales & profit by customer segments. Visualizations are generated using Plotly for interactive charts. This allows for better insights into how sales and profit vary across categories, customer segments, and time periods.

Data Source
The data used in this project is from the Sample - Superstore.csv file, which contains 9994 rows and 21 columns, providing a detailed overview of transactions such as:

Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer Details
Product Information: Product Name, Category, Sub-Category, Product ID
Metrics: Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit
Data Preprocessing
Date Conversion: The Order Date and Ship Date columns are converted into datetime format.
Feature Engineering: New features like Order Month, Order Year, and Order Day of Week are created to perform time-based analysis.
Data Grouping: The dataset is grouped based on various attributes such as month, category, and customer segment to calculate total sales and profit.
Key Visualizations & Insights
Monthly Sales Analysis
Visualized the total sales per month using a line plot. This helps track trends and patterns over time.

Sales Analysis by Category
A pie chart is used to show the contribution of each category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) to the total sales.

Monthly Profit Analysis
A line chart showing the total profit per month, providing insights into how profit fluctuates over time.

Profit Analysis by Category
Another pie chart that shows the profit distribution across the categories.

Sales and Profit Analysis by Customer Segment
A combined bar chart representing the total sales and profit for each customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

Code Execution
To run the code:

Install Dependencies:

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
pip install pandas plotly
Data File:

Download the Sample - Superstore.csv file and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
Run the Notebook:

Execute the notebook cell by cell to explore the various visualizations and data analysis.
Future Improvements
Advanced Analytics: Implement machine learning models to predict future sales and profits based on historical data.
Geospatial Analysis: Perform regional analysis by city or state to see how location impacts sales and profit.
Interactive Dashboards: Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash for a more user-friendly interface.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to handle large sales data, clean it, and extract meaningful insights through visualizations. It showcases the power of Python, Pandas, and Plotly in making data-driven decisions for business analysis.
